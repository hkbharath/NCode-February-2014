<h2>Mech Project</h2>
<p>
	A Team of Mech guys from UVCE are working on a Robot, which can cut the ripen coconut from the tree by controlling the release of 
enzymes in the tree. Team somehow manages to get the <b>Size</b> and <b>ripeFactor</b> of each coconut. If <b>Size</b> of the coconut is 
strictly greater than <b>minimize</b> or <b>ripeFactor</b> is strictly greater than <b>minRipeFactor</b> then enzymes will be controlled to 
cut that coconut, else it will not be cut.
</p>
<p>
	The team wants to analyse the efficiency of their Robot. In a tree if the Robot cuts <b>RCut</b> coconuts but actually it was required to 
cut <b>ACut</b> coconuts, then efficiency of the Robot will be <b>RCut &div; ACut</b>. Write a program to calculate the efficiency of the 
Robot.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
First line contains <b>T</b>,number of test cases.</br>
In each test case</br>
First line contains 3 space separated integers <b>N</b> (number of coconuts in the tree), <b>minSize</b> and <b>minRipeFactor</b>.
In next <b>N</b> lines <b>i th</b> line contains two space separated integers <b>Size</b> and <b>ripeFactor</b> of <b>i th</b> coconut.
Next line contains single integer <b>ACut</b>. 
</p>  

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case print the simplified fraction of <b>RCut/ACut</b>. For clarity refer to the Sample Inputs and Outputs.
</p>

<h3>Constrains</h3>
1 <= <b>T</b> <= 10</br>
1 <= <b>N</b> <= 10<sup>5</sup></br>
0 <= <b>Size, ripeFactor, minimize, minRipeFactor</b> <= 10<sup>9</sup></br>
1 <= <b>ACut</b> <= <b>N</b></br>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
1</br>
5 5 150</br>
1 120</br>
7 133</br>
3 153</br>
5 100</br>
2 150</br>
4</br>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
1/2

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Robot will cut <b>RCut</b> = 2 coconuts, it was actually required to cut <b>ACut</b> = 4 coconuts, so <b>ACut/RCut</b> is <b>2/4</b>, and simplified ratio is <b>1/2</b>
